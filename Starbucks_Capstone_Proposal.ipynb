    "In today's world, marketing is an indispensable component if each and every industry. Marketing particularly assists business to increase their brand awareness in the consumer market, which eventually will help them to boost their chances of growth. According to [Wall Street Journal](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets-1485234137), companies are allocating as high as 24% of their budget towards marketing every year, with an average of 11%. While allocations within the marketing budget can vary from company to company, it generally includes advertisement and discounts. With such a significant amount of budget being spent on marketing, companies are seeking intelligent ways to spend their money optimally. Many companies nowadays have analytics departments that advise them on identifying potential areas to target. The is where Machine Learning, and Data science in general, starts to play a crucial role. There are various studies exploring the application of machine learning in marketing optimizations [[1]](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/197751/), [[2]](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=o_YtDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR12&dq=marketing+optimization+machine+learning&ots=g81vbAw2gu&sig=KNG4Uj6LcZYpJxZiQHBYwCSEVnY#v=onepage&q=marketing%20optimization%20machine%20learning&f=false), [[3]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sushant-Vishnoi/publication/334626027_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED_MARKETING_SOLUTIONS_A_REVIEW_SUSHANT_KUMAR_VISHNOI_TEENA_BAGGA_AARUSHI_SHARMA_AND_SAADAT_NASIR_WANI/links/5d36cc114585153e5919818f/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-ENABLED-MARKETING-SOLUTIONS-A-REVIEW-SUSHANT-KUMAR-VISHNOI-TEENA-BAGGA-AARUSHI-SHARMA-AND-SAADAT-NASIR-WANI.pdf). Machine Learning methods have enables companies to intelligently decide on how and who to target with their marketing activities to improve their revenue. Take offering discounts as an example. Companies use discount offers as incentives to persuade potential customers to purchase their product(s). For obvious reasons, they cannot offer discounts to all of their potential customers as it will adversely affect the revenue. Instead, they will offer it only to a proportion of the market. Deciding on who to offer the discount to is a subject that data scientists and machine learning engineers have investigated thoroughly in the recent years [[1]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.5361&rep=rep1&type=pdf), [[2]](http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BATA-0016-0005), [[3]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3383313.3412215), identifying customer segmentations who will react favorably to marketing interventions and incentives."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Starbucks Capstone Challenge of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, we are given a number of simulated datasets which emulates customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. This app is mainly used for sending either informational messages or promotional offers. A customer might be targeted by (1) informational advertisement, (2) discount offer, or (3) buy one get one free (BOGO) offer. The data provided includes the attributes of all offers available, demographics of each customers, and features of each transaction made. While it is not possible to send all the offers to all customers, the goal of this project is to extract insights from the data provided and identify customer segmentations and particular offers that they react to better. Additionally, the aim is to design a new recommendation system which specifies which offer (if any) should be given to an individual customer."

    "# Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three datasets provided for this project. Each of these tables can help us understand how and in what way each offer is effective in persuading a customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **portfolio.json** - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.). Coming from three main families of promotions (informational, discount, BOGO), there are 10 unique promotions available in this table. There is no monetary incentive associated with informational advertisements. In the discounts offer, the customer will receive some discounts if they spend a particular amount. Lastly, in the BOGO offer, if a customer purchases a product, he/she will receive a free one as well.\n",
    "* **profile.json** - demographic data for each customer. In this table, some of the values are missing which needs to be addressed before any modeling work.\n",
    "* **transcript.json** - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema and explanation of each variable in the files are as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that each offer has a validity period before the offer expires, and this includes informational offers. In this case, we will assume that if an informational offer has X days of validity, the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for X days after receiving the advertisement. Another characteristics of the data is that a customer may complete an offer without viewing it. For instance, if a customer receives a BOGO offer with a validity of 7 days, he/she will get a free\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer."

    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."
